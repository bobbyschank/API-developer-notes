This API will take a key word, and return synonyms and antonyms
organized by parts of speech (noun, adjective, etc.)

Very easy to quickly get a working API key!
Also straightforward to use.

returned data can be in JSON, XML or PHP.

Some of the returned synonyms seem unrelated, or redundant, but overall this is a great API!
